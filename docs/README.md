## Instructions

1. Create a new markdown file or add content or change content to any existing markdown file.
   - Make sure to add some typos and/or markdown problems (e.g. increment headings by more than one level: `#` followed
     by `###` -> See the [checked problems](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#rules--aliases) for more)
   - Maybe coordinate with some peer to create merge conflicts, e.g. by changing the same line in the text below and
     then get one PR merged and observe what happens to the other PR
2. Commit to a branch and push
3. Create a PR
4. Fix all the problems to get it merged :-)
